                I want to learn how to make a basic webpage that
                has some images, graphics, animations, and
                interactables.
            </li>

                The most unique experience I've had is most likely
                traveling to Europe or doing research in the Mexican
                jungle. In Europe, I traveled from Budapest to Vienna
                to Germany to France. In Mexico, I camped out in the
                jungle and scuba dived in the ocean to observe
                wildlife.
