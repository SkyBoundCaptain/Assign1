            The two main challenges I had in this assignment were
            getting the two hyperlinks to work and getting my image
            to render. I got the hyperlinks to work by making sure
            each link was using a relative path, and for the image,
            I reviewed the lectures until I had a good understanding
            of how "img" worked. 
        </p>

            Almost everything in this assignment was new to me. 
            The main thing I learned was how to write html, but
            I also learned how to better use git and github, though
            I already had a small amount of experience with it.

            For me, the most useful thing was the lectures. After
            watching them, I pretty much had everything I needed
            to complete the assignment, and when I ran into problems,
            I was able to refer back to the lectures to figure out
            what I was doing wrong.
